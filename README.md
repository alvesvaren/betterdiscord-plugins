# BetterDiscord Things
This is my (WIP) collection of betterdiscord plugins and themes

Currently contains:
 - Spotify toggle - a simple plugin which allows you to toggle between showing and not showing the current spotify track as your status on discord from the main screen
 - Arc Dark Translucent Discord theme - a fancy translucent discord

## Spotify toggle

A simple plugin which allows you to toggle between showing and not showing the current spotify track as your status on discord from the main screen. 

Needs the [0PluginLibrary.plugin.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary/master/release/0PluginLibrary.plugin.js) file in order to work, just add it to the plugins folder aswell.

## Arc Dark Translucent Discord theme
This is a BetterDiscord port of the color scheme and theme Arc Dark. 
Create an issue if anything looks wrong or if you have any suggestions.

I made it for use with KWin + ForceBlur and BetterDiscord with "Enable Translucency" enabled.
I added support for [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord) too, however the status bar at the top looks a bit weird on windows.

I haven't tested glasscord on either linux or macos, but it should work there too.
